# PuppetDB
- All of the data generated by Puppet (for example facts, catalogs, reports) is stored in PuppetDB.
- Storing data in PuppetDB allows Puppet to work faster and provides an API for other applications to access Puppet's collected data.

  - Fairly New Features
  - Data and Only Data
  - No agent configuration
  - Used as data source
  - Replace flat files
